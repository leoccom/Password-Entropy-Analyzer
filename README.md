# üõ°Ô∏è Password-Entropy-Analyzer

## Project Summary
This script is an upgraded cybersecurity tool that assesses password strength using the industry-standard **Shannon Entropy** metric (measured in bits). It applies a core principle of Information Theory to quantify a password's randomness and resistance against brute-force attacks.

## üî¢ Entropy Methodology and Strength Ratings

The strength is determined by calculating the theoretical maximum randomness of the password.

### A. Entropy Formula

The script uses the Shannon Entropy formula to calculate the number of bits of randomness ($H$):

$$H = L \times \log_2(R)$$

Where:
* **$L$ (Length):** The total number of characters in the password.
* **$R$ (Keyspace):** The size of the character set (Assumed to be $\mathbf{94}$: 26 lowercase + 26 uppercase + 10 digits + 32 common special characters).
* **$2^H$:** The total number of possible combinations an attacker must test.

### B. Strength Ratings

The calculated entropy ($H$) is used to provide an objective security rating. These thresholds are based on common industry benchmarks for brute-force resistance.

| Entropy Score ($H$) | Rating | Rationale |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **$\mathbf{\ge 80.0}$ bits** | **Excellent / Cryptographically Secure** | High resistance to brute force; requires full complexity to qualify. |
| **$\mathbf{\ge 64.0}$ bits** | **Strong** | Meets the standard industry minimum for secure symmetric keys. |
| **$\mathbf{\ge 40.0}$ bits** | **Medium** | Necessary to defend against modern dictionary and offline attacks. |
| **$\mathbf{< 40.0}$ bits** | **Weak / Dangerous** | Highly vulnerable to rapid cracking. |

**Source Note:** The use of Shannon Entropy as a metric is based on mathematical principles. The strength thresholds (64 bits, 80 bits, etc.) align with common industry benchmarks and the security principles emphasizing length and randomness outlined in the [**NIST Special Publication 800-63B**](https://pages.nist.gov/800-63-3/sp800-63b.html) guidelines.

## Development Tools and Transparency

The core mathematical model, the entropy formula implementation, and the complexity thresholds were **designed and written manually** to demonstrate foundational principles in Math, Physics, and Security.

This project utilized AI agents for **boilerplate generation** (e.g., standard structural components) and **documentation formatting**, demonstrating proficiency in leveraging advanced tooling while maintaining ownership over the critical, skill-based components of the project.
